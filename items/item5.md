## Therapy Box

### A therapy box that combines aromatherapy and light therapy
<br />
Aromatherapy uses scents from essential oils to make the user feel relaxed. One method of aromatherapy that we found would work well for our box was the reed diffuser. These have sticks called reeds which absorb the essential oil mixture they are placed in and diffuse the scent in to the air. Light therapy is especially helpful now in the winter time. As the sun sets earlier, we experience longer periods of darkness which can make some people feel more depressed. Through light therapy, a person uses a bright lamp to add longer periods of light to their day, which can greatly improve their mood.
After doing research on these methods of therapy, my group met on Zoom and used its whiteboard to draw and brainstorm ideas about our therapy box.
After coming up with an idea, I used Adobe Illustrator to create some prototypes for our box.
Our final design was a box where the front side had a light therapy lamp and the box stored a reed diffuser inside of it. 
Looking at the top view you can see where the reed diffuser would be stored. We wanted the box to be portable around your home so the lamp
uses a USB port so that you could plug it into an outlet or a power bank if you’re using it in different places.
The sides of the box have pockets where you could store reeds or a power bank. 
To make the light accessible for different languages, we included buttons with icons instead of words
and an adjustable light that can be tilted to accommodate different heights.<br />

<u>My Angle</u> <br />
Although I wasn't familiar with aromatherapy and light therapy when one of my group members suggested the idea, doing research has shown that it is beneficial to many people. When odours are liked by the user, aromatherapy can positively affect one's mental health (Herz). Although most commonly used for seasonal affective disorder, research has also shown that when people with non-seasonal depression combine light therapy with antidepressants, it can be of great help (Even). Both forms of therapy allow the user to have control, whether that be choosing an essential oil odour that they enjoy or choosing the length of time they want to use the light therapy lamp. As a result, I believe they are good methods of therapy that we can include in our box since they do not require strict limits or procedures. <br />
My role in this project included brainstorming how to incorporate both forms of therapy into the box, designing the look of the box, and creating the drawings you see on this page.
