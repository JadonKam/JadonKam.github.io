## Task.do

#### A planning app that motivates you to finish your plans and take care of a virtual pig/plant

This app was the result of my group's interest in learning more about the daily lives of post-secondary students. We started with interviewing some students who attend a university or college and asked them questions related to their daily tasks, school work, physical health, mental health, hobbies, and more. Through our interviews, we gained research which we used to create an empathy map and persona to understand our user group better. Through understanding and analyzing our users, we discovered that a common problem that post-secondary students faced was procrastination with finishing their school work resulting in an unproductive day. This was because of reasons such as a lack of motivation, a lack of interest in the work, not planning their day well, and more. To solve this problem we created the app "Task.do".

<u>How to Use the App</u> <br />
We designed an app that allows users to set daily goals each week that they will complete every day of the week, fill out their schedule with these goals and additional tasks they have to complete on a day, and check these goals on a checklist after they are completed. Setting daily goals each week was one of our solutions to procrastination. For example, a student could set the goal of studying for 30 minutes each day of the week which would prevent them from cramming hours of studying during the few days before a test.

After setting their daily goals, the app would format them as blocks of time. Then, the user would drag and fit these blocks into their schedule and add any other tasks they would have to complete on that day.

The app also features a virtual pig and plant. The user can choose one, and their job is to complete all their tasks to take care of it. The progress bar to the left of the pig/plant represents both how many of their daily tasks the user has completed as well as how much more the pig/plant needs to be fed/watered. As the user completes their daily tasks, the progress bar will go up.

Once the user completes a task, they can check it off of a checklist. Each time the user checks a task, their virtual pig/plant will be fed/watered, and the progress bar will go up. If the user does not complete all their tasks on their checklist, the progress bar will not go all the way up, which means the pig/plant will not be fully fed/watered. The pig/plant may look worse the next day depending on how much the progress bar was filled, and many days of not completing tasks can result in the pig getting sick or the plant dying. This will help motivate the user to complete their tasks every day to keep their virtual pig/plant happy and healthy.
