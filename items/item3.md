## Therapy Box

#### A therapy box that combines aromatherapy and light therapy

Aromatherapy uses scents from essential oils to make the user feel relaxed. One method that we found would work well for our box was the reed diffuser. 
These have sticks called reeds which absorb the essential oil mixture they are placed in and diffuse the scent in to the air. 
Light therapy is especially helpful now in the winter time. As the sun sets earlier, we experience longer periods of darkness which can make some people feel more depressed.
Through light therapy, a person uses a bright lamp to add longer periods of light to their day, which can greatly improve their mood.
After our research, we met on Zoom and used its whiteboard to draw and brainstorm ideas about our therapy box.
After coming up with an idea, I used Adobe Illustrator to create some prototypes for our box.
Our final design was a box where the front side had a light therapy lamp and the box stored a reed diffuser inside of it. 
Looking at the top view you can see where the reed diffuser would be stored. We wanted the box to be portable around your home so the lamp
uses a USB port so that you could plug it into an outlet or a power bank if youâ€™re using it in different places.
The sides of the box have pockets where you could store reeds or a power bank. 
To make the light accessible for different languages, we included buttons with icons instead of words
and an adjustable light that can be tilted to accommodate different heights. 
As this project did not require a physical prototype, our design process stopped after completing these digital drawings. However, I would definitely be interested in turning this design into a reality one day.
