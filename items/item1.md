## My Most Recent Project: The 3-in-1 Coat

### A parka coat that transforms into a backpack and sleeping bag, designed to create multi-use aid for the unhoused in cold weather conditions.
<br />

<div class="CoatProject">As the world is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, having an environment where people can maintain social distance is difficult to find for the unhoused. This results in many of them not being able tp sleep in a shelter and have to sleep outside. Our design aims to provide the unhoused with better living conditions during this time as the weather gets colder. 
Inspired by Khaleel Seivwright, a carpenter who wanted to build and provide shelter for the unhoused in Toronto, my group decided that the target users for this product would be the unhoused population.

<u>Transforming the Coat to a Sleeping Bag</u> <br />
Our product can be used as a coat, sleeping bag, or backpack. The coat helps keep the user warm in colder weather and can be easily converted into a sleeping bag through folding a flap down. The sleeping bag provides warmth for the user when they go to sleep. The coat and sleeping bag use fabric with heating technology that absorbs the moisture of the user and converts it into warmth.<br /><br />

<u>Transforming the Sleeping Bag to a Backpack</u> <br />
When the jacket or sleeping bag are not being used, our design can be converted into a backpack. Flipping the sleeping bag extension inside out, turns it into an inner pocket for the backpack. By connecting the buckles on the sleeves and the coat's pockets, the sleeves will transform into the straps for the backpack. When the entire coat is zipped, and the coat is flipped upside down, it can be transformed into a backpack. Since the zipper is zipped all the way, there are no holes for anything to fall out of the backpack. The hood can then be attached to the back of the coat by buttoning the hood to the back. Once the small flap is buttoned to close the backpack, the backpack is fully transformed

<u>My Angle</u> <br />
My individual role was brainstorming of ways we could transform the coat to a sleeping bag and backpack as well as creating the drawings of the 3-in-1 coat and its transformation process. Originally, our team was thinking of the 3 objects being a coat, backpack, and blanket, but I suggested a sleeping bag would be more useful than a blanket. There was a news article that inspired us to choose this topic as it mentioned how Khaleel Seivwright's shelters were being shut down by the city (Jones). I was quite surprised by this as the city says that the shelters' potential fire safety issues are a problem, but they haven't even made an effort to contact Seivwright to inspect his shelters for safety issues. They are also shutting the shelters down when the unhoused need them the most as it is getting cold. This motivated me to think of ways we could help the unhoused and led to the creation of this product which focuses on helping keep the user warm and providing the user with a product they can use in multiple ways since purchasing a separate coat, sleeping bag, and backpack would be expensive. Just like Seivwright's shelters which he says are a temporary aid, I believe our 3-in-1 coat is a temporary aid for now as the city is still thinking of ways to find shelter for the unhoused.
