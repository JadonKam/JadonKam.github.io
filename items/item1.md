<div class="CoatProject">As the world is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, some individuals don’t have the privilege to have a secure environment to quarantine and socially distance themselves; sometimes resulting without shelter — and that is why our design aims to provide the unhoused with better living conditions during this time. 
Inspired by Khaleel Seivwright, a carpenter who wanted to build and provide shelter for the unhoused in Toronto, we decided that the target users for this product would be the unhoused population.
<br />
<br />
The unhoused are particularly vulnerable to severe weather conditions as many struggle to find shelter. In the winter, this vulnerability increases as temperature drops and makes outdoors even more inhabitable. Our project recognizes these struggles and attempts to improve living conditions for the unhoused by providing them with the means to be equipped to handle harsh weather conditions. Using a convertible and portable 3-in-1 design, we solve or improve different pain points that the unhoused population struggles with. The first component of the design, the jacket, is made of thermal clothing to keep the user warm in colder weather. When converted into a sleeping bag, the item provides adequate cover and warmth for sleep. Finally, when the jacket or sleeping bag are not in use, our design is portable enough to carry after being converted into a backpack.

Metal buckles will be added to both of the coat sleeves and front pockets. By connecting these two buckles, the sleeves will transform into the straps for the backpack. The coat’s zipper will be extended so that it continues on to the hood, allowing the hood to be zipped as well. When the entire coat is zipped, and the coat is flipped upside down, it can be transformed into a backpack. Since the zipper is zipped all the way, there are no holes for anything to fall out of the backpack. Inside the coat, there will be two flaps: one is large and one is small. When the large flap is unfolded, it becomes the bottom of the sleeping bag. When flipped inside out, the large flap turns into an inner pocket for the backpack. The smaller flap has two buttons that will attach to two buttons near the coat’s pockets. This smaller flap will become the flap that closes the backpack. We will also be implementing heat technology into the coat, which would be similar to Uniqlo’s “HEATTECH” thermal apparel.</div>
